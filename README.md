UE20CS312 - Data Analytics Mini Project

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of
death throughout the United States, with an
estimated 840,768 deaths in 2016. However,
through simple lifestyle changes and screening,
nearly 200,000 deaths per year could be avoided.
We will investigate which data features are most
indicative of the disease. Our dataset has standard
health information and information on the
presence/absence of cardiovascular disease for
over 70,000 patients. Here, our objective is not
only to design a classifier to identify the presence
of cardiovascular disease but also to determine
which features and types of data (demographic,
examination, and social history) are most useful
for predicting the disease
