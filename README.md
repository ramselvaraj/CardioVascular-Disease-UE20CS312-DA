## UE20CS312 - Data Analytics Project
<br>
This is a data analytics project that focuses on predicting cardiovascular disease using machine learning algorithms. In this project, we compared the performance of two popular machine learning algorithms for classification: Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier.

## Data

We used the [Cardiovascular Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) from Kaggle, which contains 70,000 records of patients' medical information. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and whether the patient has cardiovascular disease or not.

## Methods

We first preprocessed the dataset by performing data cleaning, feature selection, and normalization. We then split the dataset into training and testing sets and trained the Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier models on the training set. We evaluated the models' performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results

Our results showed that the Random Forest Classifier outperformed the Decision Tree model, achieving an accuracy of 0.85 compared to 0.77 for the Decision Tree model. The Random Forest Classifier also had higher precision, recall, and F1 score than the Decision Tree model.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can be effective in predicting cardiovascular disease. The Random Forest Classifier showed better performance compared to the Decision Tree model, which suggests that it may be a better choice for this type of problem. This project can be extended further by exploring other machine learning algorithms and tuning hyperparameters to improve the models' performance.
